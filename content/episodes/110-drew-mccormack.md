Drew McCormack ([@drewmccormack](http://twitter.com/drewmccormack)) is the founder of the Mental Faculty, an independent developer based in The Netherlands. Recently, Drew introduced a new, open source cloud syncing framework for Core Data called [Core Data Ensembles](http://github.com/drewmccormack/ensembles). I recently caught up with Drew to discuss this new open source framework.
