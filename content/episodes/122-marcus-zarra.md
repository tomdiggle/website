## Show Notes

Marcus Zarra ([@mzarra](http://twitter.com/mzarra)) is the Legal and Financial director at [Martian Craft](http://martiancraft.com). He has written a [book on Core Data](http://pragprog.com/book/mzcd2/core-data) and contributes regularly to Stackoverflow.com [answering developer's Core Data questions](http://stackoverflow.com/users/10673/marcus-s-zarra). In this interview, I caught up with Marcus at NSConference 6 in Leicester, England to discuss his fairly controversial talk on no using 3rd party frameworks and libraries.
