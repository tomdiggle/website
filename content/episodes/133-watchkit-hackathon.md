On Sunday November 23, 2014, the world's first Apple Watch hackathon took place at the Hacker Dojo in Mountain View, California. There were many ideas and contest entries. Check this episode out to get an idea of some of the projects people worked on. As I've recently moved to Silicon Valley, I hope to bring more interviews from live events like the WatchKit Hackathon.
