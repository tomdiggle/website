While at the [360idev](http://360idev.com) Developer Conference in Denver, Colorado, I decided to hold a last minute lunch session and talk to a few people. In this episode, we chat with Andres Linde and Micheal Simmons about HockeyApp, Collin Donnell about Developer productivity and I debate Stephen Vanterpool about the pros and cons of Singletons.
