Kendall Gelner ([@kendaldevdiary](http://twitter.com/kendaldevdiary)) recently gave a talk on advanced debugging tips and tricks at the local [Boulder iOS developer's](http://boulderios.com) group. Saul caught up with Kendall after the meetup to chat about some of the highlights of this difficult topic.
