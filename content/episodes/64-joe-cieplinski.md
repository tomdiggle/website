Joe Cieplinski ([@jcieplinski](http://twitter.com/jcieplinski)) is the design guy at [Bombing Brain Interactive](http://bombingbrain.com). While at [360idev](http://360idev.com) in Denver, we chatted with Joe about his conference presentation, The Race to the Bottom, and how to avoid it. We chat about pricing your apps in the app store, and alternatives to the freemium model that is so pervasive in the AppStore these days.
