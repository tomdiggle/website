[WWDC](http://developer.apple.com/wwdc) is the event of the year for all Cocoa, Mac and iOS developers. In this episode, a few developers share with me some of the projects and products on which they've been working.

**Editorial Note**: The audio quality of this episode is not how we like to regularly release episodes. However, we wanted to publish these interviews due to the content contained in each one.
