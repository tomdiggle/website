Samantha John ([@SamJ0hn](http://twitter.com/samj0hn)) is the co-founder of Hopscotch Technologies and co-creator of Daisy the Dinosaur and Hopscotch apps for the iPad that help teach kids about programming. Saul was able to catch up with Samantha at WWDC13 and chat a little about how Daisy the Dinosaur are doing, how they're made, and what's next for these amazing apps.
