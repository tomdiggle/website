Michael Jurewitz ([@jury](http://twitter.com/jury)) is back working at Apple, a small fruit company in Cupertino, CA. Previously, he was head of product design at [Black Pixel](http://blackpixel.com), and prior to that, he was a Developer Tools Evangelist, also at Apple. In this episode, we talk to Michael Jurewitz about things you can do to be more successful in the either the iOS or Mac App Stores.

## Editorial Note
This episode was recorded in November 2012, while Michael Jurewitz was working at Black Pixel. This episode was previously never released because of the numerous technical issues that occurred while recording. The audio quality is not great, however, as we will be unable to re-interview Michael Jurewitz for the foreseeable future, we thought it was best to release this episode.
